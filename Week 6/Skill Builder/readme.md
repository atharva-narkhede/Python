[Write a program to find all permutations of a string.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%206/Skill%20Builder/permutation.py)

[A string S is passed as the input. The program must print the number of articles in S. The string S passed as the input need not be correct grammatically.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%206/Skill%20Builder/grammatical.py)

[Dr. Nadal is given a string of ‘n’ characters(S[1], S[2],...., S[n]). Then he is given Q ranges of the form [L R]. Determine of S[L], S[L+1]... S[R] is a palindrome.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%206/Skill%20Builder/DrNadal.py)

[Write a program to obtain an integer from the user and generate the OTP using the below steps.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%206/Skill%20Builder/generate_OTP.py)

[Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%206/Skill%20Builder/dollar.py)

[Write a program that takes a string, and returns a new string with any duplicate consecutive letters removed.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%206/Skill%20Builder/duplicate_String.py)

[Write a program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%206/Skill%20Builder/add_ing.py)

[A string S is passed as the input. Two words W1 and W2, which are present in the string S are also passed as the input. The program must find the minimum distance D between W1 and W2 in S (in forward or reverse order) and print D as the output.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%206/Skill%20Builder/minimum_dist_w1_w2.py)

[Bowman planned a vacation to Alphabet Land. He had to solve a problem to enter Alphabet Land. He was given N recipes made up of lower case English alphabets. The recipes were indexed from 1 to N. R[1], R[2], ….., R[N]. He had to group identical recipes and put them into bags. Help Bowman print the indices of the recipes in each bag.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%206/Skill%20Builder/bowman.py)

[Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'poor' from a given string, if 'not' follows the 'poor', replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'. Return the resulting string.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%206/Skill%20Builder/substring_not_poor.py)
