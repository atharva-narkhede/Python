# WEEK 3

[Inverted Hollow Pyramid The much-awaited event in the entertainment industry every year is the "Screen Awards". This year the event is going to be organized on December 25 to honor the Artists for their professional excellence in Cinema. The Organizers of the event, J&R Events, decided to design some attractive and LED Matrix panel boards for the show promotions all across the venue. The event organizers wanted to program the display boards with some specific pattern using alphabets and special characters. Help them write a program to design the pattern of an inverted hollow pyramid in the matrix panel, given the number of lines of the pattern.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%203/Challenge%20Yourself/Inverted_Hollow_Pyramid.py)

[Peter and Casino   Hotel Royal Gardenia has arranged for an elite business party for the lead industrialists and celebrities of the City. Followed by a dinner buffet, the Event coordinators planned for some casino game events for the high-toned crowd. Peter was a visitor at the party and he takes some number of rubles to the casino with the intention of becoming rich. He plays three machines in turn. Unknown to him, the machines are entirely predictable. Each play costs one ruble. The first machine pays 20 rubles every 25th time it is played; the second machine pays 80 rubles every 120th time it is played; the third pays 8 rubles every 12th time it is played.  Given the number of rubles with Peter initially (there will be at least one and fewer than 1000), and the number of times each machine has been played since it last paid, write a program that calculates the number of times Peter plays until he goes broke.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%203/Challenge%20Yourself/Peter_and_Casino.py)

[Fair Francis  "Think Academy" has arranged for a competitive test for engineering students from rural villages. Those successful students of the test will be awarded the scholarship for their GRE/TOEFL preparations at Think Academy. Francis, the co-coordinator and founder of the academy has N different problem sets and there are N students who are appearing for the test. Each problem set contains zero or more problems. He will give each student exactly one problem set. But the problem sets might contain a different number of problems in each one, which looks unfair.  Since Francis is a fair tutor, he decided to move some problems from the problem set to another problem set (he can do this multiple times), until all problem sets contain the same number of problems.  Sometimes it's impossible to do so, and he might need to delete some problems completely before moving any problem, then he will start moving the problems. He needs your help to write a program to calculate the minimum number of problems to be deleted, and the minimum number of problems to be moved.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%203/Challenge%20Yourself/Fair_Francis.py)

[Math Challenge   In connection to the National Mathematics Day celebration, the Regional Mathematical Scholars Society had arranged for a Maths Challenge Event where high school students participated in large numbers. The first level of the challenge was an oral quiz, followed by a written test in the second round.  In the second round, the problem that the students had to answer goes like this:  For every positive number ‘n’ we define a function streak(n)=k as the smallest positive integer k such that n+k is not divisible by k+1.  E.g:](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%203/Challenge%20Yourself/Math_Challenge.py)

[Lucky Cards   The Hatfield Game Fair is the premier event of its kind for adults interested in some intellectual and cognitive brain games. Exciting games were organized for kids between the ages group of 8 and 10. One such game was the "Lucky Cards", a simple two-player game, played with a deck of cards. The cards in the deck have these possible names: two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king, ace. The cards labeled jack, queen, king, ace is collectively known as high cards.  The numerical equivalent of the high cards is as given below:  Jack – 11  Queen – 12  King – 13  Ace - 1](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%203/Challenge%20Yourself/Lucky_Cards.py)
