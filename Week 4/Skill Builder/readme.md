# Neocolab Week 4 Skill Builder

[Write a program that accepts n numbers from the user, stores them in a tuple, and prints the length, maximum and minimum number from the tuple.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%204/Skill%20Builder/print_max_min_length_of_tuple.py)

[Given a number N followed by 2 lists A and B of N integers each. Form a 3rd list C of size N where each element of list C is the sum of the respective elements in lists A and B.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%204/Skill%20Builder/Given_a_number_N.py)

[Write a program that accepts n numbers from the user, stores them in a tuple, searches for an element in the tuple, and sorts the tuple.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%204/Skill%20Builder/store_search_sort_tuple.py)

[Write a program that has a list of numbers both positive as well as negatives. Create a new tuple that stores only the positive values from the list](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%204/Skill%20Builder/store_positive_values_from_list.py)

[You are given a list. For each element present in the list your task is to print the next smallest number than that number. If it is not the smallest print -1.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%204/Skill%20Builder/print_next_smallest_element_in_tuple.py)

[Write a program to create a list of tuples with the first element as the number and the second element as the square of the number.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%204/Skill%20Builder/print_the_tuple.py)

[Write a program to sort a tuple of tuples by 2nd item](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%204/Skill%20Builder/sort_tuple_of_tuples_by_2nd_item.py)

[Write a program to remove duplicate numbers from a list.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%204/Skill%20Builder/remove_duplicate_from_a_list.py)
